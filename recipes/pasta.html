    <h1>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. 
        The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. 
        If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. 
        My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
    <p>Prep Time: 10 mins<br>
        Cook Time: 15 hrs<br>
        Total Time: 25 minutes<br>
        Servings: 4</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>

            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>

            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>

            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally <br>until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li><br>
            
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast <br>garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.<br> Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li><br>

            <li> Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian <br>parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li><br>

            <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li><br>
        </ol>
